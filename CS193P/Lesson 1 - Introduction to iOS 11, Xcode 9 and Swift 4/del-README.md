## Programming Assignment 1  
Lesson 1's lecture  

When you copy and paste the view it copied and pasted it's method  
Had to right click on the view and disconnect the connection to the original action  

Swift is an extremely strongly typed language and strong type inference (it will guess the type for you)  

Action creates a method  
Outlet creates an instance variable or property  

Make multiple cards using an array so that the application can be data driven  
Create an Outlet Collection - an array of things in the UI
